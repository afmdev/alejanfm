<p>Hi, I am Alejandro <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">.

Welcome to my profile, I've recently graduated as a Full-Stack Developer and during the last few years I've been focusing and working as a HTML / CSS layout developer. </p>

<p></p>It has been a privilege to be a student at @Codeacademyberlin where, after a 5 months full-time intensive course, I have enhanced my skills to be able to develop several projects using technologies such as JavaScript, React, TypeScript, MongoDB, Firebase, Node, Express, Rest API, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, Figma. </p>

<p>My previous experience as a Front-End Designer, combined with my recent graduation as a Full-Stack Develpoer, make me a well-rounded candidate who can bring great value and versatility. </p>
